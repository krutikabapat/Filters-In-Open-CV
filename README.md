Various filters applied on Images in Open-CV

1.Homogenous Blur:-
In this technique, each pixel value is calculated as the average value of the neighborhood of the pixel defined by the kernel.
Kernels used in the homogeneous blur is called normalized box filter.

2.Gaussian Blur:-
In image processing, a Gaussian blur (also known as Gaussian smoothing) is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect in graphics software, typicThe visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen,

3.A bilateral filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter for images. It replaces the intensity of each pixel with a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels. This weight can be based on a Gaussian distribution.
